		<h1>A Primer On Learning Data Science & Machine Learning</h1>


	</head>


	<body>

		I have put together a few resources that have been recently helpful in developing my skills in data science and machine
		 learning and keeping me aware of what’s happening in the community. Many times, I misplace links and forget where
		 I found a certain piece of information so this is an attempt to have a central place for myself and also a quick resource
		  to you if you are a beginner in this field or may serve as a place to gain one or two new reads!

		<h2>I. Learning</h2>

		In my humble opinion, a lot of learning can be done online and through self-study in DS/ML. However, the caveat is
		there needs to be a drive to actually immerse yourself in learning and growing. An easy route is to do a bootcamp,
		but if you do not have thousands of dollars at your disposal – there is an alternative route and that is: do it
		yourself! A good way to learn the practice is to have a project in mind and while you work through it, go through lessons and
		tutorials mentioned here to learn as you work through exploratory data analysis, pre-processing, model building, visualizing,
		and the whole works. I have a list of courses/programs which I quite like and have done a bit of background research on.
		These could be great starting points for a beginner/intermediate skilled person.

		<h3>Online Learning</h3>
		<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome">Machine Learning | Coursera</a>
		<p>
		This is the iconic machine learning course by Andrew Ng (co-founder of Coursera).
		I would say this is a rite of passage of sorts if you want to become a machine learning engineer.
		He also created a series of courses to break into deep learning on <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/">deeplearning.ai</a>, which is an
		effort to make quality AI education accessible. As you can see, there is no shortage of platforms which can help transform you into a prolific data scientist or ML engineer.</p>

		<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/">Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp | Udemy</a>
		<p>This is a course I went through on Udemy and is taught by Jose Portilla. There are a few videos on Deep Learning that use TensorFlow 1,
			where the implementation might be a bit outdated given the eager release of TensorFlow 2 - but the theory remains.
Jose Portilla is a pretty comprehensive instructor and I took another course from him: <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-sql-bootcamp/?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_campaign=SQL_v.PROF_la.EN_cc.US_ti.7862&utm_content=deal4584&utm_term=_._ag_88317033068_._ad_390132043803_._kw__._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_aud-567556828225:dsa-774930038369_._li_9032298_._pd__._&matchtype=b&gclid=Cj0KCQiA6IHwBRCJARIsALNjViUe_Y8eITDe3w0iD3Mp9rijJxfGmS7kWrXrbFYZIR61EGCZVPpYsc8aAtayEALw_wcB">The Complete SQL Bootcamp</a>
 which takes you through database querying skills with PostgreSQL, however, it is a great starting point to learn SQL in general and apply to other databases. Although
these courses are not free, they are usually offered at a pretty affordable price (I paid $13 USD for each) and the lessons definitely pay off.</p>


<a href="https://www.dataquest.io/">DataQuest</a>

<p> I sampled the <b>Data Scientist - Python</b> track and I have enjoyed the sequential route that it takes to teach.
	I will admit that it took me a moment to get acquainted to the built-in console, but DataQuest does offer a large amount of
	lessons for free. You can upgrade to a monthly or annual subscription to gain access to more tutorials lectures, but I didn't
	find that I needed to.</p>
<p>They have a <a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog">blog</a> as well, which is filled with a wealth of information and where I read from often.</p>



<h2>II. Resources</h2>
Here is a non-exhaustive list of articles and papers which point to conversation happening in the DS/AI space.
It is important to know the limitations, developments, and at times controversial outlooks to prompt conversation while networking, doing meetups, etc.

<h3>Articles</h3>

<p>This is a list of recent reads which have been on my mind.</p>

<a href="https://tinyurl.com/r9oaft4">Where to Get Free Datasets for Projects</a>

<p>There are bountiful possibilities in trying to pick a project or dataset to dissect. Here is an article (found on DataQuest’s blog). </p>

<a href="https://ericmjl.github.io/essays-on-data-science/">Essays on Data Science | Eric Ma</a>

<p>Essays addressing the practice of data science and how software skills can enhance this practice. </p>

<a href="https://thegradient.pub/an-epidemic-of-ai-misinformation/">An Epidemic of AI Misinformation</a>

<p>This article talks about the disconnect between people in the AI space and the general public in terms of the capabilities of AI
	and what it can achieve. As you compound knowledge in this field, it is always important to keep having the conversation
	 of ethics in data as your career progresses.</p>


<a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/11/6-open-source-data-science-projects/">6 Exciting Open Source Data Science Projects you Should Start Working on Today</a>
<p>This is a post by Analytics Vidhya talking about a few exciting open source projects.
	Contributing to open source projects can be a huge factor in assessing someone’s skills in interviewing for jobs; keep an eye on these!</p>


<h3>Papers</h3>

<a href="https://tinyurl.com/vlt8yn5">Stop Explaining Black Box Machine Learning Models for High Stakes Decisions and Use Interpretable Models Instead</a>

<p>This paper by Cynthia Rudin discusses the downsides of using blackbox modeling for decision making in sensitive fields such as healthcare and
	offers an alternative to it.</p>

<p>You can reference a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mG4imMEAAAAJ&hl=en">list of Andrew Ng’s publications</a> throughout the years
	which can give you valuable background into some novel ML methods and to see how methodology has evolved.</p>

<h3>	Content </h3>

<p>Here are a few new places I've been going to for learning: </p>

<p>Chip Huyen is a ML connoisseur and created the Stanford TensorFlow course and has published multiple books.
	Her <a href="https://github.com/chiphuyen">GitHub</a> contains tutorials from her course, tools, and useful exercises.</p>

<p>	Chris Albon’s <a href="https://chrisalbon.com/">website</a> contains a plethora of machine learning notebooks that you can peruse and follow along with. He also created machine learning flashcards, which can be a quick way to review topics and formulas.</p>

<p>Some tech companies make it a goal to discuss projects that they work on in engineering and data science.
	One of my favorites is Stitch Fix’s <a href="https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/">blog</a> as they do a thorough job explaining algorithms that they commonly use such as in creating recommendations.
	Other interesting blogs include Netflix, Uber, etc.</p>




<h2>	III. Communities </h2>

<p>	These are a list of communities that may be invaluable to making connections and working on projects.  </p>

	<h3>Kaggle </h3>

<p>	<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> is a community which is essential in truly learning and participating in the reach of data science.
	Companies or organizations usually post a dataset plus a challenge they’d like to address and people team up or
	individually contribute to the project and there’s often a cash incentive. It is always interesting to go through
	kernels to see how people approached a challenge and there’s also articles and tutorials which you can follow along with. People can post
 their kernels which includes their work on a certain project and the community is open to discuss and improve upon each of these.</p>

<h3>	DataKind </h3>

		Speaking of ethical data science - <a href="https://www.datakind.org/">DataKind</a>! This community is volunteer based and you
		can contribute through working on data science projects that are impactful. This past October I
		participated in the very first DataDive sponsored by Microsoft Launch AI Accelerator. I got to work on <a href="https://twitter.com/bjdewilde">@bjdewilde</a>’s
		team on a remote, one-day effort to come up with a viable enough solution for Bloc to improve suggestions to resumes using natural
		language processing and text analysis tools. Giving back is one of my favorite things and I hope to stay involved in future DataKind events.



	<h3>Twitter</h3>

	<p>I firmly believe that Twitter can be instrumental in connecting you with individuals who are leading in the spaces you are interested in.
	Recently, I came across <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/using-twitter">The Hollow Guide to Using Twitter</a>, especially in accelerating yourself
	in the professional space. As someone who is just
	starting to utilize this tool, I can say I already have made a few interesting connections.</p>

	Here is a list I have accrued of people I enjoy following and reading from. They usually post/RT related content and keeps me updated on what is
	going on in DS/ML and they will also occasionally post or endorse resources which you can add to your toolbox.
	I will definitely be adding to this list as I find more people to follow on Twitter!

	<h3>Final Remarks</h3>
	<p>There is a lot of noise out there – hope this was helpful in refining at least first steps to gaining traction in
	building data science or skills in machine learning (or both). Also, staying cramped up in a room and coding all day won’t
	be enough in growing this career. It is invaluable to make connections online and offline to grow your knowledge base and truly fall
	in love with the incredible work people are doing out there.</p>
